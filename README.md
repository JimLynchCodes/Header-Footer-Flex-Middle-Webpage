# Header Footer Flex Middle Webpage

An example of a common layout for a web page or web app that leverages flex positioning.

This is useful for sites that have a small header and footer and need the middle section to stretchto fill the remaining space. With older css methods it has been historically pretty difficult to line everything up perfectly and have the context extend the full height or the page, no more and no less. However, with some flex position this becomes a breeze.
